Colaba,Featured Neighborhoods,"Colaba ([koËˆlaËbaË]; or ISO: KolÄbÄ) is a part of the city of Mumbai, India. It is one of the four peninsulas of Mumbai while the other three are Worli, Bandra and Malabar Hill. During Portuguese rule in the 16th century, the island was known as Kolbhat. After the British took over the island in the late 17th century, it was known as Kolio.[citation needed]
The name Colaba comes from Kolabhat, a word in the language of Kolis, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, before the arrival of the Portuguese.[2] The area that is now Colaba was originally a region consisting of two islands: Colaba and Little Colaba (or Old Woman's Island). The island of Colaba was one of the Seven Islands of Mumbai ruled by the Portuguese.
The Portuguese had acquired these lands from the Sultanate of Cambay by the Treaty of Vasai (1534). The group of islands was given by Portugal to Charles II of England as a dowry when he married Catherine of Braganza in 1661. The cession of Mumbai and dependencies was strongly resented by Portuguese officials in Goa and Mumbai, who resisted transfer of possession for several years, while the English representatives were confined to the island of Anjediva while negotiations continued. Angered by the back-tracking, Charles II leased these lands to the British East India Company for a nominal annual rent. Gerald Aungier, second Governor (1672), and the president of the English settlement of Surat, took possession of Colaba and Old Woman's Island on behalf of the Company in 1675.",Mumbai,"If you are here for the first time like us, it is a convenient choice to use Colaba as a base for travel.

Managed by the Committee of Management, the entire cost of this mansion was donated by Cowasji Jehangir. This gallery is situated at Kala Ghoda, behind the Prince of Wales Museum, in South Mumbai near the Gateway of India, and has four exhibition halls. The gallery was designed by G.M.Bhuta for G.M.

The gallery has been turned inwards due to a combined function of an auditorium and an art gallery.

Lord Elphinstone established the Central Museum of Natural History, Economy, Geology, Industry and Arts, the first museum in Bombay in 1855; George Buist took the major initiative for its inception. In 1857, it was closed to the public and its collection was shifted to the Town Hall. In 1858, George Birdwood was appointed curator of the museum.

Flora Fountain,Fountains,"Flora Fountain is a Fountain located at the Hutatma Chowk is an ornamentally sculpted architectural heritage monument located at the southern end of the historic  Dadabhai Naoroji Road, at the Fort business district in the heart of South Mumbai, Mumbai, India. Flora Fountain, built in 1864, depicts the Roman goddess Flora. It was built at a total cost of Rs.Â 47,000, or 9,000 pounds sterling, a large sum in those days.[1]
The fountain originally intended for the Victoria Gardens, is now surmounted by the figure of Plenty (""Courtesy of Special Collections, University of Houston Libraries.""). History of the Flora Fountain is traced to the time when the Old Mumbai Fort was demolished in 1860 as part of the then Governor, Sir Bartle FrÃ¨re's efforts to improve civic sanitation (municipal improvements) and the urban space requirements of the growing city. Prior to this demolition, the Fort had been built between 1686 and 1743 by the British East India Company with three gates (the Apollo Gate, the Church Gate and the Bazaar Gate), a moat, esplanade, level open spaces on its western fringe (to control fires) and residences. A small road called the Hornby Road, named after the then Governor of Bombay (Mumbai) between 1771 AD and 1784 AD, also existed at the old Fort area.[2][3] Consequent to the demolitions, the Hornby road was widened into a broad avenue and on its western side commercial plots were developed to build new commercial buildings in Neo Classical and Gothic Revival designs. The Dadabhai Naoroji Road (D. N. Road), developed into a veritable sight of colonial splendor with Crawford Market linked to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus anchoring the northern end and the Flora Fountain, forming the southern end of the Mile Long Road.[4]
The Flora Fountain was erected at the exact place where the Church gate (named after St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai ) stood before its demolition along with the Mumbai Fort. It was constructed by the Agriâ€“Horticultural Society of Western India, out of a donation of Rs 20,000 by Cursetjee Fardoonjee Parekh. Designed by Richard Norman Shaw, it was sculpted in imported Portland stone by James Forsythe. A white coat of oil paint has to some extent marred the antiquity of the structure.[1]
The fountain was originally to be named after Sir Bartle FrÃ¨re, the Governor of Bombay at the time, whose progressive policy had resulted in many of the great public buildings of Mumbai.[5] However, the name was changed before the fountain was unveiled as Flora Fountain, named after Flora, a Roman Goddess of flowers and the season of spring; her majestic and pretty Portland stone statue adorns the top of the fountain. The four corners of the fountain have four life-sized female mythological figures carrying foliage to represent the four seasons.[6][7][8][9][10]",Mumbai,good place to visit with family very clam and peaceful place,4.0,18.9324959,72.83150053374067,Landmarks

Karnala Fort,Historical Sites,"Karnala Fort (also called Funnel Hill[1]) is a hill fort in Raigad district, Maharashtra, India, about 10Â km from Panvel city. Currently it is a protected place lying within the Karnala Bird Sanctuary. It was a place of strategic importance since it overlooked the Bor pass, which connected the Konkan coast to the interior of Maharashtra (Deccan Plateau)[1] on the main trade route between these areas.
The fort was likely constructed before 1400, under Devagiri Yadavs(1248â€“1318) and the Tughlaq rulers (1318â€“1347), Karnala  was the capital of the north Konkan districts of their respective empires.[2]  It later fell under the command of the Gujarat Sultanate but in 1540 was taken over by Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar. The Gujarat sultans then requested the help of the Dom Francisco de Menenzes the commanding officer of the Portuguese at Bassien (modern day Vasai) to win it back. He ordered 500 of his soldiers to Karnala fort and they were able to capture it. The fort was left in charge of the Gujarat Sultanate but with Portuguese garrisons.[3]
The Gujarat sultans fled to Vasai, surrendering the fort to the Portuguese. The loss of Karnala enraged Nizam Shah, who  sent 5,000 men to reclaim the fort and the surrounding countryside.[3] The attempt was unsuccessful, and the Portuguese continued to hold the fort. Deciding that the forts of Sangli and Karnala were of little strategic value, however, the Portuguese viceroy agreed to return them to Nizam Shah for an annual payment of Rs. 17,500 (or 5,000 gold Pardoas).[3][4]",Kalamboli,"The waterfall can be seen from the road and it takes about 2 km to walk from the main road to the waterfall.

Kiddington,Entertainment Centers,"Kiddington is a village on the River Glyme in the civil parish of Kiddington with Asterleigh about 7 miles (11Â km) southeast of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. The village is just north of the A44 road between Woodstock and Chipping Norton.
The toponym is Old English, recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Chidintone, meaning ""estate of a man named Cydda"".[2] Historically Cuddington has been an alternative form. It has also been known as Nether Kiddington to distinguish it from the hamlet of Over Kiddington 0.5 miles (800Â m) south of the village.
Offa of Mercia gave Kiddington, with Heythrop, to Worcester Priory in about 780.[3] After the Norman conquest of England the manor was held successively by the De Salcey, Willescote or Williamscote, Babington, Browne and Browne-Mostyn families.[4] After the English Reformation the Browne family were recusants with their own Roman Catholic chapel and priest, and they ensured the survival of Catholicism in this part of Oxfordshire.[5] Kiddington Hall was built in 1673, and in the 18th century ""Capability"" Brown laid out the gardens.[6] In 1850 the architect Charles Barry rebuilt the house so completely that no external trace of the original building is visible, added a new stable block and remodelled the gardens.[7]",Mumbai,"This historic library has many world-famous manuscripts, considered priceless works of art and literature such as the original manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy, many 14th-century books, many cultural events, from museums to Mumbai University and the High Court.",4.5,51.902818,-1.3988084,Entertainment

The island Ko Chang occupies most of the district's land area, along with several smaller islands. With an area of 210Â km2 (81Â sqÂ mi), Ko Chang is the third-largest island in Thailand by area, after Phuket and Ko Samui.[2] The name Ko Chang means 'Elephant Island' and derives from its elephant-shaped headland. Despite the presence of elephants on the island, they are not indigenous. At present, there are eight villages on the island.[1]
Prior to World War II, Ko Chang was little known.

It is primarily a posh residential area with lush greenery, but of late has been growing into a commercial hub as well. Koregaon Park also has a trendy dining and nightlife hub, with sleek European and Indian restaurants, plus live music bars, buzzy pubs and trendy cafe. It is also a destination for art and music enthusiasts in the city with many art galleries and clubs in the vicinity.[1] Koregaon Park is located about 5.8 kilometres (3.6Â mi) from the Pune International Airport and about 3.8 kilometres (2.4Â mi) from the Pune Junction railway station.
Earlier Ahmednagar road (simply Nagar road) was known as Koregaon road, since Koregaon Bhima village also falls on this road. Koregaon Bhima village was the site of a major battle between British East India Company and Peshwas in 1818.
In early 1920s, British settled a neighbourhood on the lands of Ghorpuri village, which was just outside of Pune. This neighbourhood was named Koregaon Road Estate, since this was in proximity to then Koregaon road (today's Ahmednagar road). The estate was divided into various numbers of plots, many of which were auctioned and purchased mostly by rich merchants or princely/royal families of India. Some specific plots were also kept reserved for the Military and Postal Department. This caused Koregaon Road to become one of the most up-market area in Pune which continues till today.[2]",Pune,"Pune is considered to be one of the safest city for night life and pub crawling and Koregaon park is one such charming lane where there are lots of pubs within radius of 2-3 kms.

Korlai Fort,Historical Sites,"Korlai Fort is a colonial fort in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India.[1] Formerly a part of the Chaul in Portuguese India,[2] the structure is a specimen of Portuguese colonial architecture.[3] It was built as a companion to the fort at Chaul, at this strategic position the Portuguese could use it to defend their province which stretched from Korlai to the Fort Bassein.[4] Vestiges of the Portuguese occupation are manifested in the distinct dialect of the Korlai villages inhabitants which is a Luso-Indian creole called Korlai Portuguese Creole.
This fort was built in 1521 by the Portuguese with the permission of the Ahmednagar sultanate. In 1521, taking advantage of the confusion in the aftermath of the death of the Burhan Nizam the Portuguese tried to take over the fort.[5] However the sultan retaliated and sent some of his best men to reclaim the fort. Subsequently, a truce was reached in which the Ahmednagar sultanate occupied the island and no further fortification of the island took place. Only a wooden cross remained on the island as a sign of its former rulers.
However, in 1594, Abranches, a Portuguese captain with 1,500 soldiers and 1,500 natives took possession of the fort. The besieged soldiers of the Sultanate tried to block their way by putting a dead elephant at the main gate and a dead horse at the inner gate. But in the end they had to surrender.[6][5] The Portuguese won the fort but not having enough men to stand guard there chose to destroy it[5] leaving only the central tower and a battery intact.",Korlai,"The mausoleum of a king in the late seventeenth century, in the same region there are Mahadiv and Vitalukami temples, historical records show that he never lost any war, and was also a scholar poet and inventor, and the location of his cremation remains controversial.",4.0,18.5385991,72.90711871642196,Fort
Lenyadri Caves,Caves,"Lenyadri, sometimes called Ganesa Lena, Ganesh Pahar Caves, are a series of about 30 rock-cut Buddhist caves, located about 4.8 kilometres (3.0Â mi) north of Junnar in Pune district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Other caves surrounding the city of Junnar are: Manmodi Caves, Shivneri Caves and Tulja Caves. The Lenyadri caves date between the 1st and 3rd century AD and belong to the Hinayana Buddhism tradition.[1][2]
Twenty-six of the caves are individually numbered. The caves face to the south and are numbered serially from east to west.[1][3][4] Caves 6 and 14 are chaitya-grihas (chapels), while the rest are viharas (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of the caves, in general, are similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.[1][3][4]
Two of the central cells of Cave 7 â€“ originally a Buddhist vihara â€“ were at an unknown later date appropriated for the worship of the Hindu god Ganesha. The rest of the cells and the hall of Cave 7 remain in their original form.[5] This Ganesha Lena vihara is one of the Ashtavinayak shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra.

Lion Gate,Zoos,"Lion Gate (Greek: Î ÏÎ»Î· Ï„Ï‰Î½ Î›ÎµÏŒÎ½Ï„Ï‰Î½) is the popular modern name for the main entrance of the Bronze Age citadel of Mycenae in southern Greece. It was erected during the thirteenth century BC, around 1250 BC, in the northwestern side of the acropolis. In modern times, it was named after the relief sculpture of two lionesses in a heraldic pose that stands above the entrance.[1]
The gate is the sole surviving monumental piece of Mycenaean sculpture,[2] as well as the largest surviving sculpture in the prehistoric Aegean.[3] It is the only monument of Bronze Age Greece to bear an iconographic motif that survived without being buried underground. It is the only relief image that was described in the literature of classical antiquity, such that it was well known prior to modern archaeology.[4]
The greater part of the cyclopean wall in Mycenae, including the gate, was built during the second extension of the citadel that occurred in the Late Helladic period IIIB (thirteenth century BC).[5] At that time, the extended fortifications also included Grave Circle A, a burial place inside the city wall for royal families during the sixteenth century BC. This grave circle was found east of this gate, where a peribolos wall also was built.[6] After the expansion, Mycenae could be entered by two gates, a main entrance and a postern,[7][8] while undoubtedly, the most extensive feature was the remodeling of the main entrance to the citadel, now known as the Lion Gate, in the northwestern side built circa 1250 BC.[9]
The gate was approached by a natural, partly engineered ramp on a northwest-southeast axis. The eastern side of the approach is flanked by the steep smooth slope of the earlier enceinte. This was embellished with a new facade of conglomerate. On the western side a rectangular bastion was erected, 14.80Â m (49Â ft) long and 7.23Â m (24Â ft) wide, built in pseudo-ashlar style of enormous blocks of conglomerate. The term ""Cyclopean"" has been applied to the style to imply that the ancient structures had been built by the legendary race of giants whose culture was presumed to have preceded that of the Classical Greeks, as described in their myths. Between the wall and the bastion, the approach narrows to a small open courtyard measuring 15Â m Ã—Â 7.23Â m (49Â ft Ã—Â 24Â ft), possibly serving to limit the numbers of potential attackers on the gate. The bastion on the right side of the gate facilitated defensive actions against the right hand side of attackers, which would be vulnerable, as normally the attackers would carry their shields on their left arms. At the end of the approach stands the gate.[8]",Mumbai,"One of Mumbai's largest gardens, this is a great place for yoga and meetings.

They are universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist religious art. The caves were built in two phases, the first starting around the second century BCE and the second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to older accounts, or in a brief period of 460–480 CE according to later scholarship.[6] The site is a protected monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India,[7] and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Chaityas) and worship-halls (Viharas) of different Buddhist traditions carved into a 75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.[8][9] The caves also present paintings depicting the past lives [10] and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist deities.[8][11][12] Textual records suggest that these caves served as a monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for merchants and pilgrims in ancient India.[8] While vivid colours and mural wall painting were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves 16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient Indian wall-painting.[13]

Gateway Of India Mumbai,Churches and Cathedrals,"The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.

The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.

The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.

In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019",Mumbai,"St. Thomas Cathedral is a temple in the parish of Mumbai.

It is one of the top places to visit in Shridi Darshan tour.

The temple is dedicated Lord Hanuman, an ardent devotee of Lord Rama. There are two Hanuman idols side by side in this temple, where some weights and dumbbells are kept in a corner. It is well known that Lord Hanuman is the benefactor deity of wrestlers. It is said that during Chavadi Procession, Sai Baba used to halt at Lord Hanuman temple and waved his hands showing some strange gestures and stood quietly there for few minutes. The palki of Sai Baba which is taken out on special occasions also stops at the Maruti Mandir and the worshippers praise Sai Baba and Lord Hanuman. Peepal and Neem trees are situated in front of the temple. A Shivling along with Nandi is also installed on this site by Murthikar Bajre Rao Dalve of Bombay.

Maruti Mandir was the place where sadhus used to stay, including the ascetic Devidas, whom Baba would occasionally visit during his earlier years in Shirdi. When Baba went to Rahata with the fakir Javhar Ali in the early 1890s, his devotees were deeply unhappy at his absence from them. After about eight weeks they succeeded in persuading Javhar Ali to let Baba return to Shirdi, though he insisted on coming too. A few days later, a debate was held in this temple between Javhar Ali and Devidas. The fakir was roundly defeated, causing him to flee the area, after which Baba remained among his devotees in Shirdi until the end of his days.

Hanuman Jayanti and Ramnavami are celebrated on grand scale at this temple every year.

Datta Mandir,Other Places of Worship,"Audumbar is known for the shrine of Dattatraya held in high reverence. It is said to have been built in honour of Nar-sirhha Sarasvati who was a great saint and who is supposed to be the incarnation of Dattatraya. His greatness has been extolled in Guru Charitra written by Sarasvati Gangadhar. Narsimha was born of a poor Brahman couple, Madhava and Amba, in about 1304.

After his thread ceremony he left on a holy pilgrimage and on its completion came to Audumbar on the banks of the Krushna to engross himself secretly in religious mortification during the Caturmasa. At this time it so happened that a Brahman’s son who was dull−witted, overcome with shame at the remarks passed by the people in this regard, went to Bhuvanesvari temple on the opposite bank of the Krushna and prayed for three days and nights without taking any food. But the goddess remained unmoved by his severe penance upon which he cut off his tongue and laid it at Her feet. Taking pity the goddess advised him to go to Audumbar and pray Narsirhha. The boy taking the command went to Narsirhha and falling at his feet received the blessings of the sage. The identity of the saint having been known, thousands of people began to flock to the place for darshan.

At the end of Chaturmasa, when the sage prepared to leave, the people requested him to stay. He only left his padukas under audumbar tree over which a small shrine was erected by a devotee from Poona who also built a dharmashala.

The outer mandap is of very recent construction. The shrine is situated at a lovely spot on the banks of the Krushna and in turn commands a splendid view of the river. There is some striking scenery around.

Pashan Lake,Beaches,"Pashan Lake  is an artificial lake near the suburb of Pashan, about 12Â km from the city center of Pune, India. The lake was built in the British era to accommodate the water requirement of the neighbourhood. The main inlet of the lake is a small river (Ramnadi), which is even controlled by the barrage located to the north of the lake. The river originates from Bavdhan and flows via Pashan, Sutarwadi, Baner to Someshwarwadi before flowing into the main Mula river.[1] Pashan lake has a total catchment area of 40 square kilometres (15Â sqÂ mi), and serves as a source of water to the old Pashan village, and the Governor's residence, as well. Recent urbanisation around the lake has led to the fall in the quality of the water.
Pashan lake is a man-made lake, built to accommodate the water requirements of the Pashan and Sutarwadi suburbs. The lake was once a source of drinking water, but the recent boom in urbanisation and silting of the lake has degraded the water and made it unfit for drinking. The lake served as a source of water to old Pashan village, for growing crops and to the nearby Governor's house.[2] The lake and its surrounding area attracts migratory birds and so is popular spot for bird watchers. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has constructed a 300-metre footpath called the Nature Trail alongside the lake. It is constructed along the western shore of Pashan lake. Also, PMC has built a bamboo plantation and a wall alongside the lake to protect it and attract birds.[3]
Recently, deforestation on nearby hills has caused heavy silt formation resulting in decrease in the depth of the lake.[4] Ipomea weed is also cited as a major cause of lake's deterioration as it prohibits the growth of other plants. Also washing of trucks in the area contributes to the pollution by adding oil and petrol to the sewage. PMC estimates that 40,000 people could be provided with drinking water at per capita cost of â‚¹250 (US$3.10) as compared with the existing per capita cost of â‚¹1,500 (US$19).[5]",Pune,"I am in whatsup instagram instagram and more social affairs, if you want to feel some real peace and happiness, you have to go to this place.

The exact origin of the Areopagus is unclear. In pre-classical times (before the 5th century BC), the Areopagus may have been a council of elders for the city of Athens, and membership was restricted to those who had held high public office, in this case that of Archon.[3] Conversely, it may have also begun almost exclusively as a homicide court and judicial body.[4] While there is no true consensus, homicide trials seem to have been held on the Areopagus hill as early as the 7th century BC and possibly as far back as the mid-8th century BC.[5]
In 594 BC, the Areopagus was heavily restructured by Solon, as was the rest of the Athenian state. Aristotle suggests that he confirmed its competence over cases of treason (eisangelia, Îµá¼°ÏƒÎ±Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¯Î±) and its guardianship of the laws (nomophylakia, Î½Î¿Î¼Î¿Ï†Ï…Î»Î±ÎºÎ¯Î±).[6] Solon's entrusting of the nomophylakia to the Areopagus may imply that the council was invested with maintaining the stability of his reforms after he left Athens.[7]
Under the reforms of Cleisthenes enacted in 508/507 BC, the Boule (Î²Î¿Ï…Î»Î®) or council was expanded from  400 to 500 men, and was formed of 50 men from each of ten clans or phylai (Ï†Ï…Î»Î±Î¯). There is very little evidence to suggest that Cleisthenes may have altered the composition or the jurisdiction of the Areopagus, given that he himself was likely a member of the council.[8]",Mumbai,"[View] Itâ€™s really a super nice place here, I really like it, itâ€™s a great feeling, itâ€™s really good.",5.0,37.9724088,23.7230956,Recreation
Bandra-Worli Sea Link,Temples,"The Bandra-Worli Sea Link (officially known as Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link[1]) is a 5.6 km long, 8-lane wide bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in Central Mumbai. It is the longest sea bridge, as well as the 4th longest bridge in India after Bhupen Hazarika Setu, Dibang River Bridge and Mahatma Gandhi Setu. It is a cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts on either side. It was planned as a part of the proposed Western Freeway that would link the Western Suburbs to Nariman Point in Mumbai's main business district, but is now planned to become part of the Coastal Road to Kandivali.
The 1M bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), and built by the Hindustan Construction Company. The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge were opened to the public on 30 June 2009.[9] All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010.
The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak hours from 20 to 30 minutes to 10 minutes.[10] As of October 2009, BWSL had an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles.[11]",Mumbai,I have taken 10 days of meditation classes and it makes me a better and more compassionate person.

It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's grandson and Aurangzeb 's son Muhammad Azam Shah in memory of his beloved mother 'Rabia-ul-Daurani' alias 'Dilras Bano Begum'. It was commissioned in 1660 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the memory of his wife Dilras Banu Begum (posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani) and is considered to be a symbol of Aurangzeb's 'conjugal fidelity'.[3][4][5] It bears a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's mother, Mumtaz Mahal.[6] Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture though he had commissioned the small, but elegant, Pearl Mosque at Delhi. Bibi Ka Maqbara is the second largest structure that Aurangzeb has built, the largest being the Badshahi Mosque.[7]
The comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obscured its very own considerable charm.[8] Due to the strong resemblance, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan).[9] Bibi Ka Maqbara is the ""principal monument"" of Aurangabad and its historic city.[10][11] An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively.[9] Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.[12] Aurangzeb's son, Muhammad Azam Shah was in later years put in charge of overseeing the repair-work of the mausoleum by Shah Jahan.
Dilras Banu Begum was born a princess of the prominent Safavid dynasty of Iran (Persia)[13] and was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi (titled Shahnawaz Khan),[14] who was the viceroy of Gujarat.[15] She married Prince Muhi-ud-din (later known as Aurangzeb upon his accession) on 8 May 1637 in Agra.[16] Dilras was his first wife and chief consort, as well as his favourite.[17][18][19][20] She bore him five children â€” Zeb-un-Nissa, Zinat-un-Nissa, Zubdat-un-Nissa, Muhammad Azam Shah and Sultan Muhammad Akbar.",Aurangabad,It is a very nice place and worth going,3.8,19.901447599999997,75.32023314712913,Lakes
Afghan Church,Churches and Cathedrals,"The Church of St John the Evangelist, better known as the Afghan Church, is a church of Anglican heritage, that belongs to the Mumbai diocese of the Church of North India.[1] Located in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, it was built by the British between 1847 and 1858 to commemorate the dead of the First Afghan War and the disastrous 1842 retreat from Kabul.[2] Memorials at the rear of the nave also record casualties from the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The foundation stone was laid in 1847; it was consecrated in 1858, and work on the steeple finished in 1865.[3]

Hanging Gardens,Gardens,"The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word ÎºÏÎµÎ¼Î±ÏƒÏ„ÏŒÏ‚ (kremastÃ³s, lit.â€‰'overhanging'), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word ""hanging"" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.[1][2][3]
According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis[4] and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.[5]
The Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders for which the location has not been definitively established.[6] There are no extant Babylonian texts that mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.[7][8] Three theories have been suggested to account for this: first, that they were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden;[9] second, that they existed in Babylon, but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD;[10][4] and third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704â€“681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.[11][1]",Mumbai,"The sky garden, also known as the Hein Garden, is located on the top of the Malaba mountain in the rich area.

The caves are located off the Western Express Highway, and are surrounded by encroachments.
The caves are accessed through a long flight of stairs into the main hall of this cavernous space. It has many pillars and a Lingam at the end. Idols of Dattatreya, Hanuman, and Ganesh line the walls. There are also relics of two doormen. The cave also has a murti and footprints of goddess Jogeshwari (Yogeshwari), whom the area is named after.

Kanheri Caves,Caves,"The Kanheri Caves (KÄnherÄ«-guhÄ [kaËnÊ±eÉ¾iË É¡uÉ¦aË]) are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop in the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, on the former island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. They contain Buddhist sculptures and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century CE[1] to the 10th century CE. Kanheri comes from the Sanskrit Krishnagiri, which means black mountain.[2]
The site is on a hillside, and is accessible via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and nine caves. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa (a Buddhist Pagoda). Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water.[3] Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri caves were built in the 1st century and had become an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.[4]
Most of the caves were Buddhist viharas, meant for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, which functioned as chaityas, or halls for congregational worship, are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas. Avalokiteshwara is the most distinctive figure. The large number of viharas demonstrates there was a well organized establishment of Buddhist monks. This establishment was also connected with many trade centers, such as the ports of Sopara, Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan and Ujjain. Kanheri was a University center by the time the area was under the rule of the Maurayan and Kushan empires.[2] In the late 10th century, the Buddhist teacher Atisha (980â€“1054) came to the Krishnagiri Vihara to study Buddhist meditation under Rahulagupta.[5]",Mumbai,"The temple is located in the less crowded Condellava area near Pune, and the New Veda Cultural Center is a temple dedicated to the goddess Kristina and his goddess Rada.

The shrines were developed over the periodÂ â€“ from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE. The oldest of the cave shrines is believed to date back to 160 BCE, having arisen near a major ancient trade route, running eastward from the Arabian Sea into the Deccan. 
The group at Karla is one of the older and smaller of the many rock-cut Buddhist sites in Maharashtra, but is one of the best-known because of the famous ""Grand Chaitya"" (Cave 8), which is the largest and most completely preserved"" chaitya hall of the period, as well as containing unusual quantities of fine sculpture, much of it on a large scale.[1]
Many traders, Western Satraps of Saka origin and Satavahana rulers made grants for construction of these caves.  Karli's location in Maharashtra places it in a region that marks the division between North India and South India.[2] Buddhists, having become identified with commerce and manufacturing through their early association with traders, tended to locate their monastic establishments in natural geographic formations close to major trade routes so as to provide lodging houses for travelling traders.[3] Today, the cave complex is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.[4]",Pune,"The four ancient civilizations that span centuries of history and culture have a long history, and the world is famous for China is the Great Wall, ancient Egypt is the pyramid, and Babylon, ancient India, these ancient countries have left rich historical and cultural monuments.

National Gallery of Modern Art,Fine Art Galleries,"The National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) is the premier art gallery under Ministry of Culture, Government of India.[1]  The main museum at Jaipur House in New Delhi was established on 29 March 1954 by the Government of India, with subsequent branches at Mumbai and Bangalore.  Its collection of more than 1700 works by 2000 plus artists[2] includes artists such as Thomas Daniell, Raja Ravi Verma, Abanindranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Amrita Sher-Gil as well as foreign artists. Some of the oldest works preserved here date back to 1857.[1] With 12,000 square meters of exhibition space,[3] the Delhi branch is one of the world's largest modern art museums.
The first proposal for a National Art Gallery was made by a Delhi-based artistsâ€™ organisation, the AIFACS, in 1938.[4][pageÂ needed] This institution, initially registered as Delhi Fine Arts Society in 1929, was founded by artistâ€“brothers Barada and Sarada Ukil who were students of Abanindranath Tagore.[note 1] In 1946, the Society organised the First International Contemporary Art Exhibition that included paintings of modern French and English artists, as well as etchings from American artists. The exhibition coincided with the first All India conference, where a resolution appointing AIFACS as a central art body was passed.[4] In subsequent years, however, AIFACSâ€™ claims were diluted by the factions that arose among the artists, with the newly set up All India Association of Fine Arts, Bombay, putting forth its own agency as a central organisation at the Third All India Art conference in 1948.In 1949 Art Conference at Calcutta The government invited a consortium of artists and critics for this conference on visual arts â€” Stella Kramrisch, G. Venkatachalam, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, O. C. Ganguly, Atul Bose, James H. Cousins and Percy Brown, among others â€” and asked for their suggestions on art institutions like the National Museum and the National Gallery of Art, and the educative role of art for the general public. On the issue of the Gallery, the participants at the seminar reacted in different ways. Some such as historian Dr Nihar Ranjan Ray encouraged the government to step in and set up the representative advisory body, while others like artist and founder member of the group in Delhi, Silpi Chakra, B. C. Sanyal, argued that it was wrong for the government to take the initiative away from the artistsâ€™ hands. It passed a resolution for the early establishment of the National Art Gallery and the improvement of the National Museum, as well as the formation of the three Akademis as part of a Sub Commission for Culture of the Indian National Commission for Cooperation with UNESCO.[4]
In 1953 the Society organised the Second International Exhibition of Contemporary Art in its new building, which the national daily 'The Statesman' described as â€˜no less than Venice Beinnaleâ€™.[5] The State-supported NGMA had already come into being by 1954 and was formally inaugurated by Vice-president Dr S.Radhakrishnan, in the presence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Hermann Goetz (1898â€“1976),[8] a noted German art historian became its first curator and in time it added new facilities such as Art restoration services, an Art reference Library and a Documentation Centre.[9] The Gallery opened with an exhibition of contemporary sculpture, apart from showcasing its initial collection of around 200 works, which consisted of paintings by Amrita Sher-Gil, Rabindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Nandalal Bose, and M.

Western Ghats,Temples,"The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri mountain range, is a mountain range that covers an area of 160,000Â km2 (62,000Â sqÂ mi) in a stretch of 1,600Â km (990Â mi) parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, traversing the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.[1] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world.[2] It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India.[3] It contains a very large proportion of the country's flora and fauna, many of which are endemic to this region.[4] According to UNESCO, the Western Ghats are older than the Himalayas. They influence Indian monsoon weather patterns by intercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer.[1] The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain called the Western Coastal Plains along the Arabian Sea. A total of 39 areas in the Western Ghats, including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests, were designated as world heritage sites in 2012 â€“ twenty in Kerala, ten in Karnataka, six in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra.[5][6]
The range starts near south of the Tapti river and runs approximately 1,600Â km (990Â mi) through the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu ending at Marunthuvazh Malai near the southern tip of India. These hills cover 160,000Â km2 (62,000Â sqÂ mi) and form the catchment area for complex riverine drainage systems that drain almost 40% of India. The Western Ghats block the southwest monsoon winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau.[7] The average elevation is around 1,200Â m (3,900Â ft).[8]
The area is one of the world's ten ""hottest biodiversity hotspots."" It has over 7,402 species of flowering plants, 1,814 species of non-flowering plants, 139 mammal species, 508 bird species, 227 reptile species, 179 amphibian species, 290 freshwater fish species, and 6,000 insect species.
